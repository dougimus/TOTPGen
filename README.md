# TOTPGen

A sample Time-based one time password generator

## About this repo

I wrote this repo to fully understand how the time-based one time password algorithm works. This project includes code (base32.cs) that doesn't belong to me and is licensed as listed in the file.

## Installation

[I have not worked this out yet]

## Usage

```sh
./TOTPgen <sharedsecretnospaces>
```

## Support

No support is available. Code is as it is.

## Contributing

Feel free to offer patches. the code was a proof of concept project and doesn't require improvement as such.
